# Teach data processing classes 

This course focuses on the mastery of techniques and tools for the processing of massive data, with emphasis on the management, storage and modelling of astronomical data. It begins with an introduction to data management and storage, followed by exploration techniques, dimensional reduction, machine learning (regression and classification models) and time series analysis. In addition, collaborative work tools that facilitate code development and academic networking will be addressed. Included in the programme because of its relevance to the new generation of astronomical data, this course is essential for those seeking to keep up to date with cutting-edge techniques in data science. Classes will combine theory and practice, allowing you to apply the knowledge acquired in solving real problems through the development of computer programmes.

The use of this course is mainly focused on students. Course offered at the Universidad Central. La Serena, Chile - 2025.
